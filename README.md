# Summer 2017 Web Design at RISD — Assignment 1

## Instructions

**Do not edit this file.**

You’re creating a single-page web site using the outlining algorithm and some images from the web. **Include all your work in the starter code provided in the file `index.html`. Images, discussed below, should be placed in a folder called `img`.**

Fork this repository into your own GitHub account. Do all your work in the branch named after you and your GitHub handle, then issue a pull request back into the assignment’s repo. The **Submission Instructions** section at the end of this document has more.

## Headings

Use the outlining algorithm to mark up each of the following items, sans em dashes:

— **Artists**

— **Salvador Dalí**

— **Engineers**

— **Bookstore**

— **Art**

— **Engineering**

— **Tim Berners-Lee**

## Quoting

Wrap the following content in the proper HTML tags and add it underneath the appropriate heading. Emphasize the content “The Persistence of Memory.”

> Dalí was a skilled draftsman, best known for the striking and bizarre images in his surrealist work. His painterly skills are often attributed to the influence of Renaissance masters. His best-known work, The Persistence of Memory, was completed in August 1931. Dalí’s expansive artistic répertoire included film, sculpture, and photography, in collaboration with a range of artists in a variety of media.

## Page Title

Add content you feel is appropriate to the `title` element. Will any other element on the page contain content that is also included in the `title` element?

## Images

Find Creative Commons-licensed images online of Tim Berners-Lee and Salvador Dalí for inclusion in your document. (Note image ratios, as these will inform your design.) Either link directly to external URLs or place your images in a folder called `img`.

## Validate

Use the HTML5 validators ([https://html5.validator.nu/](https://html5.validator.nu/) or [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/)) to ensure your markup is sound, and use the HTML5 outliner ([https://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/](https://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/)) to verify your outlining algorithm makes sense.
