    <h3>Artists</h3>
      <h4>Salvador Dalí</h4>
<p>

Dalí was a skilled draftsman, best known for the striking <br>
and bizarre images in his surrealist work. His painterly <br>
skills are often attributed to the influence of Renaissance<br>
 masters. His best-known work, The Persistence of Memory, <br>
 was completed in August 1931. Dalí’s expansive artistic <br>
 répertoire included film, sculpture, and photography, in <br>
 collaboration with a range of artists in a variety of media.
